# conforl-lab
ConfoRL Lab brings provable finite-sample safety guarantees to reinforcement learning through adaptive conformal risk control. This is the first open-source implementation that marries conformal prediction theory with both offline and online RL, enabling deployment in safety-critical domains like robotics, autonomous vehicles, and clinical dosing.
